Develop an Express server with the ability to handle file uploads. The server should:

- Serve an HTML form from the root route (/) for file submission.
- Handle file uploads via a POST request to /upload.
- Utilize the Multer middleware for processing file uploads.
- Once the file has been processed by server, it needs to be uploaded to cloudinary and you need to store the url to send in the response.
- Provide feedback to the user upon successful file upload with a status code of 200 and a confirmation message.
